# üîê Security Measures

## 1. Input Validation
- All input data is validated using Pydantic models.
- Prevents injection attacks and type errors.

## 2. MongoDB Query Safety
- Uses parameterized query structures.
- No dynamic code execution or raw user inputs in queries.

## 3. Limited Data Exposure
- API only exposes computed fields, not raw internal IDs or full order details.

## 4. Localhost-only Access
- During development, the API is served on localhost (`127.0.0.1`).
- No public exposure without a deployment layer.

## 5. Authentication (To Do for future enhancement)
- Auth layer like JWT can be added for production security.
